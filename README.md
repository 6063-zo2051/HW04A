** # HOMEWORK 04 Part A **

### SUMMARY
The goal of this code is to keep track of time in a unique way. I decided to keep track of time by color change. The three tiers which I chose to display are seconds/minutes/hours.

### PLAN
My idea was first to create 3 for-loops that indicate a color specification as x increases. I wanted to split the window into three parts. I chose rectangles to start off simple.

### EXECUTION
I realized that it would be hard to impliment a for loop that considered position and time in one, and found that I actually did not need the for loop at all. I created a clock that increase color pigment with time -- yellow represents seconds, red represents minutes, and blue represents hours.
